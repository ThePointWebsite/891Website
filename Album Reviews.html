“Mister Asylum” is the brand new album from up and coming band “Highly Suspect.” Although released almost three months ago, it is just now getting the recognition it deserves. The first track shares a name with the album, and it couldn’t have been more perfectly placed.  It’s a great hit to kick off the album, nothing to exposing but also nothing held back. It’s the epitome of how crazy yet fantastic the band can be. “Lost” is the second track and has more of an edgy classic rock feel to it. With an old school twist, the tempo is upbeat and the cadence and rhythm is catchy and hypnotizing, all while telling the typical heart-break song. “Lydia” is their smash hit right now, a song that explains what it feels like to be tied down by a significant other. Some comparisons include being tied to a train track or even more dramatic, the music video shows a woman tied to the bottom of a pool. This hit has some heavier guitar riffs and a deep meaning, which is why it’s so big for this band. The next song up is “Bath Salts,” which is everything you would expect it to be; a heavy song about drug use and abuse, nothing showing too much potential and unfortunately lacking luster. “23” is also another that isn’t as appealing as I had wished. It’s definitely great if you REALLY love rock music and appreciate every aspect of it, but really only a few short catchy bridge lines for me. “Mom” is yet another deep song; the lead singer tells a story of losing his mom theoretically and the “revenger” he wishes to take on her for leaving his life. “Bloodfeather” is one of my favorites from “Mister Asylum.” It’s a sexy and dark song, with just enough edge and flavor but nothing too powerful or overwhelming. “F**k Me Up” is clearly more on the explicit side, and all about drinking, drugs and sex. Other tracks include “Vanity” and “Claudeland.” Although I really love this band, the album was not anything that completely blew me out of the water. It is their first full length album all together, so I definitely give them props for dedication and soul. I would recommend to those who love rock and anything a bit more on the edgy side.

This famous Japanese rock band released a new album in North America for first time.

The songs in this album are all English, so you do understand what they are singing. 

They perform some concerts in New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and somewhere in 

North America. So, some of you already know this band. I think this band leads 

Japanese music trends. You will know the rock trend from them even though you do not 

go to Japan. Their all songs have spirit to send some messages to listeners. Because the 

songs in this album are all in English, you will catch their messages in the songs. Their 

songs are not heavy rock, but have passion you can feel from the songs. The vocalist`s 

voice really matches with the music and is also high- toned. I used to not like this kind 

of band, but I really like this band now because the lyrics of songs are doubling with my 

life. Even though the song writer has never see my life, I feel he always observe my life. 

That is why I like this bad so much. When they created the band name, ONE OK 

ROCK, at the time they gathered together to practice, they always rent a room to 

practice. And the time was always 1 am, so they chose the name as one o`clock. But, 

they just tried to be fancy or fashionable, so they changed to ONE OK ROCK. It is still 

called, “ONE O`CLOCK” but people in the world except Japanese cannot pronounce 

ONE OK ROCK as “One o`clock,” so they officially confirm that people pronounce 

“One Okay Rock” You can call them whatever you are comfortable, but you now know 

that the official name, so you should call ONE OK ROCK as “One O`clock.” So, they 

have unique mind, and the uniqueness makes their music fascinated. People really like 

the uniqueness of the music. If you like their music, you should go to their concerts. The 

concerts are really fun, and it is much cheaper than you watch it in Japan. I really 

wanted to go to the concerts in New York City, but I could not go because the location is 

far and I do not have much time to spend to go there. So, go to the concerts with my 

spirit and enjoy their music. Please check this out and you will really enjoy it for sure.

Armed with an acoustic guitar and soulful voice, United Kingdom native Jamie Lawson has struck gold with his new self-titled album. Lawson is the first artist to be signed to fellow UK musician Ed Sheeran’s new label Gingerbread Man Records, and I think it’s safe to say Sheeran made an excellent choice in signing Lawson. Lawson’s music reminds me a lot of Ed Sheeran’s – it’s folky, soulful and serenades the wonders of love. The first track on the album, “Wasn’t Expecting That,” has already been released and is picking up popularity. The track is full of folky acoustic chords as Lawson sweetly sings about not expecting a powerful love to come from the person they’re with. It’s a simple song with a beautiful message. If you have ever been in love with someone, you will be able to relate to this song in a heartbeat. A song similar to “Wasn’t Expecting That” is “Someone For Everyone.” If you have ever been convinced that there is no one out there for you, I highly advise that you listen to this song – it will make you believe in love. It’s full of folk melodies and optimistic lyrics of love. Other songs that sound like this on the album include “The Only Conclusion” and “All is Beauty.” Lawson doesn’t only sing about the good experiences of love on this album, however. He has a song called “Still Yours,” which is about having walls built up in a relationship. He goes on to say that even if there are walls, they all belong to his love. This song in particular reminds me a lot of something Ed Sheeran would perform. It’s a simply beautiful song with a lot of potential to be a big hit it it’s released. I felt like I was listening to a love story when I listened to this album. There are so many songs on the different phases of a love story, including the part where you’re not too sure what’s going to happen. “Ahead of Myself” is a song about feeling really excited for a new relationship, but not wanting to get ahead of yourself in love. Lawson uses his beautifully soulful voice to sing about his optimism with a new love, and if you have ever been down right giddy about a new relationship, you’ll relate to this song. Overall, Jamie Lawson has made a stellar debut with this self-titled album. He may even become the next Ed Sheeran – check out the album to see if you agree!

  <td class="cushycms"><p>Snare Lustrous Doomings: Of Montreal<br>
    ★★★★☆ <img src="testing/Images/ofmontreal.jpg" width="153" height="153" /></p></td>
<td class="cushycms"><div id="review"><div style="height:200px;width:300px;border:1px solid #ccc;overflow:auto;" class="editable" id="untitled-region-20">
		TOf Montreal is a quirky band from Athens, Georgia, named after a failed romance

with a woman from, or “of Montreal”. The band began in 1996 with front man Kevin Barnes, 

and has a number of albums filled with upbeat sounding songs about life, love, and 

nostalgia. While the songs may sound upbeat, they actually are saturated with deeper 

meaning, often found only if investigating the lyrics. Snare Lustrous Doomings is 90 

minutes long, and consists of 19 live tracks pulled from many of their previous albums. 

While the tracks on this album aren’t new, they revive their old songs in such a 

way that it’s almost incomparable to the original. The thing that really renews these songs 

is that the original band members have come and gone, so this album only holds one 

original piece: Kevin Barnes, the founder. “Triumph of Disintegration” is one song that 

sounds completely new. “Of Montreal” revamped the bass line, added some keyboard, and 

made an almost new song, much better than the original. 

“Obsidian Currents” is a good example of “Of Montreal’s” trippy side, which is a lot 

of their appeal. This song is comparable to some of Pink Floyd’s trippy hits from the past, 

which is why so many millennials enjoy it. It’s similar to the music their parents made them 

listen to as kids, but they can call it their own. The slow, almost dragging guitar chords, the 

chill bass line, and Barnes relaxing voice creates the perfect music for sitting around, 

considering the meaning of life. 

In quick contrast to this, the next song on the album is “Time Will Show the Wiser”, 

a cover of one of “Fairport Convention’s” hits. This song has a fast paced, rock and roll 

sound which proves to their listeners that they are not a one trick pony. “Of Montreal” can 

conquer any genre they choose, manage to be meaningful and catchy, and is capable of 

staying a part of the Indie community for almost 20 years. This album only shows their 

dedication to their fans, and their music.

		The anticipated ‘Revival” is finally here, but the title is false advertising in my opinion. 

Selena has hyped up this album for months to come, but a majority of the songs are very 

boring and lack any emotion. With such a title, I expected something incredibly different 

from Miss Gomez, something renovating. “Kill em with Kindness” is somewhat decent, only 

because it has a strange chorus and beat drop, but that’s about it. “Hands to Myself” is 

pretty okay for that exact same reason; a cool background beat with a catchy tempo, but I 

especially like this song because it’s a sexier side of Selena that nobody has seen much. 

“Same Old Love” is her newest hit, the first of this year being “Good For You.” Both are right 

in the middle of the pop spectrum, something she’s been known for and good at since her 

career started. I love both of those songs; although I was skeptical at first. “Camouflage” 

was a slower song that I found absolutely beautiful. It was straight raw vocals over some 

simple and soft piano, telling a story about feeling invisible and lost after losing someone. 

“Me and the Rhythm” is something out of Selena’s element. Although I don’t LOVE it, it 

reminds me of a slower dance electronica song, which I applaud her for taking a risk. 

“Survivors” is yet another that I did not like, unfortunately. It sounds like old pop music, with 

a beat that does not change much throughout the song at all. “Body Heat” was absolutely 

atrocious. It reminds me of J-Lo mixed with Janet Jackson, but done in all the wrong ways. 

“Rise” was a song that just truly made me angry. It sounds exactly like “Colors of the Wind” 

from Pocahontas. It lacks originality, and genuineness. Overall, I was super disappointed 

with this album. I would really only recommend to anyone who is a die hard Selena Fan.

Now this album was a huge surprise. Artists are always covering Taylor Swift's songs, but it's very rare for another artist to go ahead and cover an entire album! Ryan Adams has done just that with the smash hit album 1989, originally by obviously by Taylor Swift. I'm a huge fan of the original 1989, and I'm a huge fan of this cover album. While the original was a complete pop album, this cover is classic Ryan Adams. That sweet sounding indie/alternative/country style that he has really compliments Swift's original song writing. Even songs I thought were weaker on Swifts album, I see truly thrive with Ryan Adams helming the tune. It's a very strange experience re-listening to the entire album again from a new perspective. The songs are mostly done in Ryan Adams classic acoustic style, but a couple of them have a much more rock feel, like his remake of “Style”. Stand-outs on the album are “Blank Space”, “Wildest Dreams” and “Style”. All of these songs get a total revamp from the originals and are very refreshing to hear done in a new line as opposed to the radio hits. Oddly enough, this same this negatively effects other songs. “Shake It Off” just doesn't feel as right without the peppy Pop beats. I would definitely consider it one of the weaker songs on the album simply because of how used we are to the original version. This is definitely a song geared at a specific group of people who prefer and certain genre. Pop/Taylor Swift fans as a whole may not be as interested in this album, but people who are more into the Indie/Alternative scene will definitely be more into this album. I ended being a huge fan of this album, Ryan Adams has always been one of my favorite musicians, and I was ecstatic to find out that he was doing this album. I definitely think this is worth a check, especially to see the how Taylor Swift sounds from a different perspective.

Parkway Drive has once again proved themselves to be one of the major players in modern 

metalcore.This album incorporates skull crushing breakdowns, melodic guitar solos, and brutal 

lyrics.

The album starts off with the powerful "Destroyer",

"I'm dragging nails through my skin" the curious line that starts off "Dying to believe." This song 

filled with religious metaphors is a song of pure hatred.

"Vice grip" is one of the more "hardcore-esque" songs on the album, there are melodic 

breakdowns and crowd sing-alongs. The music video is amazing, it depicts the band going off to 

war in a fighter jet.

"Fractures"is the second track to constitute a music video.

"Writings on the wall" is a breathe of fresh air from the relentless metal pounding. This song 

starts with a lengthy violin and drum duet, sans vocals, vocals only enter in a few minutes 

through.I wouldn't really call it sanging, rather speaking the lyrics in this case.

The final song of the album happens to be my favorite. For the first 40 seconds a gentle acoustic 

melody plays, afterwards the band transforms back into metal but it is not as brutal as some of 

the other songs.

Get ready to connect to your inner child as you turn this album up. Cry Baby is the debut 

album of singer, Melanie Martinez. Martinez, who was coached by Adam Levine on the voice, 

has been rocking the indie pop world. The album debuted in August, 2015. Her song “Carousel” 

was used for the show American Horror Story: Freak Show. Cry Baby has a very unique aspect 

to it. All of the songs names are something related to children and babies. Some of the songs 

include “Dollhouse”, “Alphabet Boy”, and “Mrs. Potato Head”. It feels strange to listen to songs 

that sound like childish things, but Martinez was able to connect childhood with all of the dramas 

in lives now. She basically shows that things are sugarcoated for children and you start learning 

the realities of life as you grow up. Melanie is also impressive with her thought out instrumental. 

Many of the songs have a feeling of actually being on a carousel or playing with dolls. The song 

“Pity Party” is also based on the well-known song “It’s My Party” by Lesley Gore. Martinez 

herself is an unique individual. She seems to not follow everybody else which is great to see. If 

you are into electropop or indie pop, check out Cry Baby by Melanie Martinez to hear this 

amazing artists unique work.

★★★☆☆<img src="Images/jess-glynne-album-artwork-1431417802-custom-0 (1).jpg" width="153" height="153" /></p></td>
<td class="cushycms"><div id="review"><div style="height:200px;width:300px;border:1px solid #ccc;overflow:auto;" class="editable" id="untitled-region-14">

Jess Glynne’s new album “I Cry When I Laugh” is filled with optimistic and intellectually provoking tunes.  Including chart toppers like “Rather Be” and “Hold My Hand” this product delivers an impressive resonance with its audience. The first song “Gave Me Something” displays a bright ambience, a song that is dedicated to the person that gave her the strength to pursue a career in her dreams, a singer. “Hold My Hand” holds a similar jazzy aura to the first, Glynne using her subtle yet power vocals to express the hope that is found in this inspirational number. “Real Love” uses an electronic flair while incorporating instruments such as violins to illuminate the beauty in one of the most invigorating emotions on this planet, love. This song also compliments the smash hit “Rather Be” with the Clean Bandits, using similar audio tactics that helps the piece express the feeling behind wanting to be with the ideal individual.  “Ain’t Got Far to Go” and “Take Me Home” like many songs on this album encompass the hardships the Glynne has faced and the obstacles many of us face on a daily basis, and once again shine with their positive undertones, giving an individual who feels lost or afraid some clarity in their conflicts. There are songs on this album which also give a refreshing contradiction, such as “Don’t Be So Hard On Yourself” and “It Ain’t Right”, one being about crawling from the abyss of self-deprecation and rising to the depths of love and confidence, the other about the uncertainty of leaving behind someone who causes distress, being incapable of leaving the darkness behind. While this album has a familiar sensation to it, it also tackles a variety of themes, allowing listeners to feel uplifted by the messages, or being able to cope with problematic circumstances, leaving a refreshing atmosphere in one’s wake, making it a pleasant listen.

Kid Astray put out a first album full of fantastic songs. There were a few songs that stood out to me in particular: “Diver”, “Still Chasing Nothing”, “No Easy Way Out”, and “Not A Kid Anymore”.
 
“Diver” has a more somber feel than the rest of the album, which really made me stop and listen. The song reminded me at the beginning of the second of silence where you are about to jump off of something and your adrenaline is pumping and everything comes into pinpoint clarity. “Still Chasing Nothing” got me into the song right away, it opening with some instrumental, and then the instrumental paused for a moment before it picked up again. This is a song that I could definitely see people listening to on a trip or in the morning as they drive somewhere. “No Easy Way Out” had the opposite feel to the song than what the title may suggest, it had happy and hopeful beat, that’s what really drew me into the song, along with the line “you keep your head up high the future doesn’t look to bright right now. I feel like everyone can relate to those lines at some point in their lives. The song “Not A Kid Anymore” opens with a strong bass beat that made me stop pause and listen harder to the song. If they play this song in concert I can imagine that people will be clapping their hands to the beat as they sing along.
 
This whole album was about the painful transition into adulthood that you have to go through once you reach a certain age where you no longer have to be “Home Before the Dark”. Something that was cool about this album, were the subtle mentions of other songs or to the album title, within each of the songs. Though only a select few songs off of this album were mentioned, every single song off of this album was absolutely wonderful. Some of the songs off the album had an almost eighties feel to them. I hope that they are currently not set to tour the United States, hers to hoping they get popular enough the end up touring in the states.
